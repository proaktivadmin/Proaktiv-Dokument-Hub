# Proaktiv Dokument Hub

**Proaktiv Dokument Hub** is a modern, high-performance dashboard for managing, editing, and previewing Vitec Next document templates. Built with **React**, **Node.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**, it provides a seamless "Glassmorphism" UI for real-time document editing.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🖥️ Modern UI & Experience

*   **Swappable Layout:** Instantly toggle between "Editor First" and "Preview First" layouts using the `<->` toolbar button.
*   **Responsive Panels:** Draggable resizers for the file explorer, editor, and preview pane.

### 📝 Advanced Template Management
*   **Live Code Editor:** Monaco Editor (VS Code style) with HTML syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
*   **Smart Categorization:** Organize templates into categories (folders) with drag-and-drop support (via file system).
*   **Search & Filter:** Instant search for templates (`Ctrl+F`).
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
    *   `Ctrl+S`: Save
    *   `Ctrl+Shift+S`: Save as New Version
    *   `Ctrl+D`: Duplicate Template

### 📱 Real-time Simulators

    *   **Desktop:** "New Outlook" Web Interface styling.
    *   **Mobile:** Modern iOS Outlook App styling with Dynamic Island.

### ☁️ Cloud Architecture & Persistence
