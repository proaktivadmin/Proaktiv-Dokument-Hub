- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + Shadcn/UI + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL
- **Hosting**: Railway (production live)
- **Storage**: WebDAV integration

Current version is V3.1 with Office & Employee Hub features completed. The project has extensive existing documentation in `CLAUDE.md` and `.cursor/` directory.
