# Vitec HTML Ruleset

> **Source of truth for Vitec Next template HTML patterns.**
> Produced by Documentation Agent (Phase 11, Agent 1).
> All rules are evidence-based, derived from `docs/Alle-flettekoder-25.9.md` (6,494 lines of production HTML), `.cursor/vitec-reference.md`, and **133 Vitec Next tagged database templates** (queried via PostgreSQL MCP).
> Patterns marked **(DB evidence: "Template Title")** were discovered from database template analysis.

> **CRITICAL WARNING — NO-TOUCH KARTVERKET & GOVERNMENT TEMPLATES**
>
> Several templates in this system are **legally regulated government forms** (Kartverket, Landbruksdirektoratet, Kommunal- og moderniseringsdepartementet) used for property registration (tinglysing), concession declarations, and sectioning applications. These templates **MUST NEVER be modified, edited, or altered in any way.**
>
> **Additionally:** These protected templates were converted to work within Vitec Next but are **NOT built according to Vitec Next best practices.** They contain workarounds and patterns that should **NOT be used as reference** when developing or updating regular templates. The rules in Sections 1–12 of this document define best practices — the Kartverket forms in Section 14 are archival documentation only.
>
> **See Section 14 for the complete list of no-touch templates and rules.**
