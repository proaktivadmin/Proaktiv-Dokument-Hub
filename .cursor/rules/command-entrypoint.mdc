description: Command entrypoint and gate policy for consistent execution

# Command Entrypoint Policy

## Default Command Routing

- Feature implementation: start with `/implement`.
- Template request work: use `/process-template-requests`.
- Debugging failed builds/deployments: use `/debugger`.

## Lane Selection Policy

- `/implement` defaults to single-agent execution.
- Escalate to multi-agent orchestration only when one or more triggers apply:
  - context protection,
  - true parallelization,
  - specialization/tool-routing need.

## Mandatory Gates

- Before release readiness recommendations: run `/verify-gates`.
- After implementation/debug sessions: run `/token-audit`.

## Commit/Deploy Hygiene

- Use `/commit-safe` for scoped commits.
- Use `/deploy-gates` before any deploy recommendation.

## Goal

Maximize useful output per monthly token budget by reducing rework and enforcing consistent flow.
