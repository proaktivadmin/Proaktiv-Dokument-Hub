# Agent Efficiency Rules

## Primary Goal

Reduce token waste and rework by enforcing short feedback loops and explicit gates.

## Required Execution Pattern

1. Plan briefly before implementation.
2. Implement in small batches.
3. Verify early with the right verifier before moving to QA.
4. Stop and surface blockers instead of speculative rewrites.

## Token Budget Rules

- Prefer narrow file scopes over broad repo sweeps.
- Use subagents only for context-heavy or parallelizable tasks.
- Keep prompts concise and outcome-specific.
- Reuse canonical context from `.cursor/context-registry.md`.
- Avoid repeating full instructions in command wrappers.

## Debugging Rules

- No more than 2 blind fix attempts without root-cause evidence.
- Capture: repro, expected vs actual, evidence, fix, verification.
- Add or update regression tests when bug scope allows.

## Delivery Rules

- Require spec/verifier gates before QA for feature work.
- Report pass/fail with explicit next owner when blocked.
- Prefer deterministic scripts/tools over ad hoc manual workflows.
