# HTML Hub - Installation Guide

Welcome to your HTML Hub! Before we can get everything running, we need to install a couple of essential tools.

## 1. Install Node.js
Node.js is the engine that runs our server and build tools.
1.  Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version for Windows.
3.  Run the installer and follow the prompts (accept defaults).

## 2. Install Git
Git is used for saving versions of your work and syncing with GitHub.
1.  Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
2.  Download the **"64-bit Git for Windows Setup"**.
3.  Run the installer. You can accept all the default settings (just keep clicking "Next").

## 3. Verify Installation
Once you've installed both, please restart your computer (or at least your terminal/VS Code) to make sure the changes take effect.

Then, let me know you are ready!
